Window property:
    Icon
    ResizeMode: CanResize(default), CanMinimize(can minimize, not to maximize it or drag it bigger or smaller), NoResize
    ShowInTaskbar: true(default), false(your window won't be represented in the Windows taskbar)
    SizeToContent: decide if the Window should resize itself to automatically fit its content. Width, Height and WidthndHeight
    Topmost: false(default), true(your Window will stay on top of other windows unless minimized)
    WindowStartupLocation: 
    WindowState: Normal, Maximized, Minimized
    
App.xaml:
    is the declarative starting point of your application.
    StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml":
        this is actually the part that instructs which Window or Page to start up when the application is launched.
        In some situations, you want more control over how and when the first window is displayed. In that case, you 
        can remove the StartupUri property and value and then do it all from Code-Behind instead. this will be demonstrated below.
        
StaticResource and DynamicResource:
    a static resource is resolved only once, which is at the point where the XAML is loaded.
    a dynamic resource is resolved once it's actually needed, and then again if the resource changes.
    
data-bingding:
    {Binding Path=NameOfProperty}
        the path notes the property that you want to bind to, however, since Path is the default property of a binding, 
        you may leave it out if you want to, like this: {Binding NameOfProperty}
    
    {Binding Path=Text,}
    
GridSplitter:
    is used in nearest <Grid></Grid>. similiar to break.
